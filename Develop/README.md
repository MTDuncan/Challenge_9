# Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

## Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, having a high-quality README for the app is essential. The README should include what the app is for, how to use it, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. This increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

To help you create a high-quality README, you can use a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project.

## Installation

To use this application, you will need to have Node.js and the Inquirer package installed on your computer. 

1. To install Node.js, please follow the instructions outlined in the Node Installation Guide on the Full-Stack Blog to ensure that you're using Node.js v16.
2. To install the Inquirer package, please run `npm i inquirer@8.2.4` in the terminal.

## Usage

To use this application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the starter code repository and make your own repository with the starter code. Do not fork the starter code repository!
2. Create a `.gitignore` file and include `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store/` so that your `node_modules` directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your `.gitignore` file before installing any npm dependencies.
3. In the terminal, navigate to the root directory of your project.
4. Install any required dependencies by running `npm install` in the terminal.
5. Run the application by running `node index.js` in the terminal.
6. Follow the prompts in the terminal to provide the necessary information for your project.
7. Once you have answered all the questions, a `README.md` file will be created in the root directory of your project.
